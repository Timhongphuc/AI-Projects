# SimplestLabs Â©2024 
## by Tim Seufert

SimplestLabs is a series of projects I made by myself to learn more about AI in Python and to learn how to handle Platforms like Gradio oder HuggingFace.
The one main project at SimplestLabs in the moment is SimplestMachine (Tim AI). For more information get yourself a quick look at our sources.
